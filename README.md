# README for dl simulation


## changelog
coming soon


## stat
- level 80, circle node(50/50).
- dojo(30/30) altar(30/30) 
- have Wind Shrine/Yuletree/Sweet Retreat level 30, so wind/water/light unit have more str than flame/shadow
- no dracolith, no fafnir statue.
- equiped str 60% except water unit, which use "Dragonyule Jeanne". if you don't have "Dragonyule Jeanne", water unit will lose about 4% DPS.
- equiped "Resounding Rendition", since WP is additive with Dragon, 15% str provide less than 10% damage.
- equiped MUB 5star element weapon

## commen combo chain the simulation uses:
- sword: c3+fs
- blade: c5+fs(failed) (that kind of technique introduced by me) (reference: https://www.bilibili.com/video/av38956687/)
- dagger: c5+fs(3hits) (you can hold FS reverse to change your direct in the c5 jump)
- axe: c5+fs / plain c5 (if mentioned that unit don't use fs)
- lance: c5+fs / c5+fs(failed) (if mentioned that unit don't use fs)
- bow: plain c5 and c1+fs, simulate 2 times
- wand: plain c5


## Not take into consideration: (means that you should add some score yourself to unit have that kind of abilities)
- co-abilities
- Shapeshift
- Dragon's Law
- Phraeganoth/physian/Demon Bane
- Last Offense 
- Slayer's Strength/Striker's Strength

## Conditional boost that the simulation assumed as 100% uptime : (means that you should reduce some score to unit have that kind of abilities by your own opinion)
- Flurry Strength 
- Full HP = Strengt
- HP 70% = Strength
- 30 Hits = Energy Level Up
