<h2>commen combo chain the simulation use:</h2>

<ul>
<li>sword: c3+fs</li>
<li>blade: c5+fs(failed) (that kind of technique introduced by me) <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/av38956687/">reference</a></li>
<li>dagger: c5+fs(3hits) (you can hold FS reverse to change your direct in the c5 jump)</li>
<li>axe: c5+fs / plain c5 (if mentioned that unit don't use fs)</li>
<li>lance: c5+fs / c5+fs(failed) (if mentioned that unit don't use fs)</li>
<li>bow: plain c5 and c1+fs, simulate 2 times</li>
<li>wand: plain c5</li>
</ul>

<h2>Not take into consideration:</h2>

<h4>(means that you should add some score yourself to unit have that kind of abilities)</h4>

<ul>
<li>co-abilities</li>
<li>Shapeshift</li>
<li>Dragon's Law</li>
<li>Phraeganoth/physian/Demon Bane</li>
<li>Last Offense </li>
<li>Slayer's Strength/Striker's Strength</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conditional boost that the simulation assumed as 100% uptime :</h2>

<h4>(means that you should reduce some score to unit have that kind of abilities by your own opinion)</h4>

<ul>
<li>Flurry Strength </li>
<li>Full HP = Strengt</li>
<li>HP 70% = Strength</li>
<li>30 Hits = Energy Level Up</li>
<li>One type of Affliction can proc 3 times in one battle. (Since you can't proc any affliction to High dragon)</li>
</ul>

<h2>special mechanics</h2>

<ul>
<li>Not take energies into teamwide DPS</li>
<li>Simulate unit that have bleed 1000 times, and show the average DPS. Min and Max DPS is list after his name.</li>
</ul>
