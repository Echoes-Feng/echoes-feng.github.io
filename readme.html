<h1>README for dl simulation</h1>

<h2>changelog</h2>

<p>coming soon</p>

<h2>stat</h2>

<ul>
<li>level 80, circle node(50/50).</li>
<li>dojo(30/30) altar(30/30) </li>
<li>have Wind Shrine/Yuletree/Sweet Retreat level 30, so wind/water/light unit have more str than flame/shadow</li>
<li>no dracolith, no fafnir statue.</li>
<li>equiped str 60% except water unit, which use "Dragonyule Jeanne". if you don't have "Dragonyule Jeanne", water unit will lose about 4% DPS.</li>
<li>equiped "Resounding Rendition", since WP is additive with Dragon, 15% str provide less than 10% damage.</li>
<li>equiped MUB 5star element weapon</li>
</ul>

<h2>commen combo chain the simulation uses:</h2>

<ul>
<li>sword: c3+fs</li>
<li>blade: c5+fs(failed) (that kind of technique introduced by me) (reference: https://www.bilibili.com/video/av38956687/)</li>
<li>dagger: c5+fs(3hits) (you can hold FS reverse to change your direct in the c5 jump)</li>
<li>axe: c5+fs / plain c5 (if mentioned that unit don't use fs)</li>
<li>lance: c5+fs / c5+fs(failed) (if mentioned that unit don't use fs)</li>
<li>bow: plain c5 and c1+fs, simulate 2 times</li>
<li>wand: plain c5</li>
</ul>

<h2>Not take into consideration: (means that you should add some score yourself to unit have that kind of abilities)</h2>

<ul>
<li>co-abilities</li>
<li>Shapeshift</li>
<li>Dragon's Law</li>
<li>Phraeganoth/physian/Demon Bane</li>
<li>Last Offense </li>
<li>Slayer's Strength/Striker's Strength</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conditional boost that the simulation assumed as 100% uptime : (means that you should reduce some score to unit have that kind of abilities by your own opinion)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Flurry Strength </li>
<li>Full HP = Strengt</li>
<li>HP 70% = Strength</li>
<li>30 Hits = Energy Level Up</li>
</ul>
